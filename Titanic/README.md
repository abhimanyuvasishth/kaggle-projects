# Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

I use Logistic Regression (with some polynomial and interaction terms) to predict whether passengers in the Titanic dataset survived or didn't survive.

To run the code: 

+ Download the datasets from [the Kaggle Titanic Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)
+ Save the datasets in a folder called `data` in the same directory as the `titanic.ipynb` file
+ Run the code. It should output a file called `submission.csv`
