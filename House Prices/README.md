# House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques

I use Linear Regression (with some polynomial terms) to predict house prices for residential homes in Ames, Iowa. The Notebook outlines steps I took for EDA, data cleaning, feature engineering, standardization and model selection to solve this problem.

To run the code:

+ Download the datasets from [the Kaggle House Price Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)
+ Save the datasets in a folder called `data` in the same directory as the `house_prices.ipynb` file
+ Run the code. It should output a file called `submission.csv`
